How can I fix the problem? I successfully installed the library, but when I am trying to import it I receive an error ImportError: libXrender.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory . Examples Why do you call cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB) in your examples? Usage Which transformation should I use to convert a NumPy array with an image or a mask to a PyTorch tensor: ToTensor() or ToTensorV2() ? How can I find which augmentations were applied to the input data and which parameters they used? My computer vision pipeline works with a sequence of images. I want to apply the same augmentations with the same parameters to each image in the sequence. Can Albumentations do it? I want to augment 16-bit TIFF images. Can Albumentations work with them? Augmentations have a parameter named p that sets the probability of applying that augmentation, but they also have the always_apply parameter that can either be True or False . What is the difference between p and always_apply ? Is always_apply=True equals to p=1.0 ? When I use augmentations with the border_mode parameter (such as Rotate ) and set border_mode to cv2.BORDER_REFLECT or cv2.BORDER_REFLECT_101 Albumentations mirrors regions of images and masks but doesn't mirror bounding boxes and keypoints. Is it a bug? I created annotations for bounding boxes using labeling service or labeling software. How can I use those annotations in Albumentations? Installation \u00b6 I am receiving an error message Failed building wheel for imagecodecs when I am trying to install Albumentations. How can I fix the problem? \u00b6 Try to update pip by running the following command: python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip I successfully installed the library, but when I am trying to import it I receive an error ImportError: libXrender.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory . \u00b6 Probably your system doesn't have libXrender . To install the libXrender package on Ubuntu or Debian run: sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install libxrender1 To install the package on other operating systems, consult the documentation for the OS' package manager. Examples \u00b6 Why do you call cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB) in your examples? \u00b6 For historical reasons , OpenCV reads an image in BGR format (so color channels of the image have the following order: Blue, Green, Red). Albumentations uses the most common and popular RGB image format. So when using OpenCV, we need to convert the image format to RGB explicitly. Usage \u00b6 Which transformation should I use to convert a NumPy array with an image or a mask to a PyTorch tensor: ToTensor() or ToTensorV2() ? \u00b6 Always use ToTensorV2() . ToTensor() is a legacy transformation that contains complex and unnecessary logic for mask transformation. We don't want to break the existing pipelines that use that transformation, so instead of changing the behavior of the original ToTensor() , we created a new, more simple transformation. ToTensor() is now deprecated and will be removed in future versions. For all new projects, you should always use ToTensorV2(). How can I find which augmentations were applied to the input data and which parameters they used? \u00b6 To save and inspect parameters of augmentations, you can replace Compose with ReplayCompose. ReplayCompose behaves just like regular Compose, but it also saves information about which augmentations were applied and which parameters were uses. Take a look at the example that shows how you can use ReplayCompose. My computer vision pipeline works with a sequence of images. I want to apply the same augmentations with the same parameters to each image in the sequence. Can Albumentations do it? \u00b6 Yes. You can define additional images, masks, bounding boxes, or keypoints through the additional_targets argument to Compose . You can then pass those additional targets to the augmentation pipeline, and Albumentations will augment them in the same way. See this example for more info. I want to augment 16-bit TIFF images. Can Albumentations work with them? \u00b6 Yes. Albumentations can also work with non-8-bit images. See this example for more info. Augmentations have a parameter named p that sets the probability of applying that augmentation, but they also have the always_apply parameter that can either be True or False . What is the difference between p and always_apply ? Is always_apply=True equals to p=1.0 ? \u00b6 When always_apply is set to True , Albumentations will always apply that transform, even if p is set to a value less than 1.0 . However, always_apply=True doesn't equal to p=1.0 because with always_apply=True , Albumentations will apply a transform even in a case when top-level containers are not applied. Let's look at an example when a container Compose contains one augmentation Resize : transform = A . Compose ([ A . Resize ( height = 256 , width = 256 , p = 1.0 ), ], p = 0.9 ) If you set p=1.0 for Resize and p=0.9 for Compose , then Resize has a 90% chance to be applied, because there is a 90% chance for Compose to be applied and if Compose is applied, there is a 100% chance for Resize to be applied. But if you set always_apply=True for Resize , Albumentations will apply it with 100% probability even if Albumentations decides not to apply the parent container ( Compose in the example): transform = A . Compose ([ A . Resize ( height = 256 , width = 256 , always_apply = True ), ], p = 0.9 ) When I use augmentations with the border_mode parameter (such as Rotate ) and set border_mode to cv2.BORDER_REFLECT or cv2.BORDER_REFLECT_101 Albumentations mirrors regions of images and masks but doesn't mirror bounding boxes and keypoints. Is it a bug? \u00b6 Unfortunately, adding extra bounding boxes or keypoints to reflected regions of the image is not supported. You can change border_mode mode to cv2.BORDER_CONSTANT if this causes a significant impact on the training of your model. I created annotations for bounding boxes using labeling service or labeling software. How can I use those annotations in Albumentations? \u00b6 You need to convert those annotations to one of the formats, supported by Albumentations. For the list of formats, please refer to this article . Consult the documentation of the labeling service to see how you can export annotations in those formats.","title":"Frequently Asked Questions"},{"location":"faq/#frequently-asked-questions","text":"Installation I am receiving an error message Failed building wheel for imagecodecs when I am trying to install Albumentations.

Consider using tifffile - https://github.com/blink1073/tifffile Define an augmentation pipeline that works with 16-bit TIFF images \u00b6 Under the hood, Albumentations supports two data types that describe the intensity of pixels: - np.uint8 , an unsigned 8-bit integer that can define values between 0 and 255. - np.float32 , a floating-point number with single precision. For np.float32 input, Albumentations expects that value will lie in the range between 0.0 and 1.0. Albumentations has a dedicated transformation called ToFloat that takes a NumPy array with data types such as np.uint16 , np.uint32 , etc. (so any datatype that used values higher than 255 to represent pixel intensity) and converts it to a NumPy array with the np.float32 datatype. Additionally, this transformation divides all input values to lie in the range [0.0, 1.0] . By default, if the input data type is np.uint16 , all values are divided by 65536, and if the input data type is np.uint32 , all values are divided by 4294967295. You can specify your divider in the max_value parameter. The augmentation pipeline for non-8-bit images consists of the following stages: First, you use the ToFloat transform to convert an input image to float32. All values in the converted image will lie in the range [0.0, 1.0] . Then you use all the necessary image transforms.

Data scientists and machine learning engineers need a way to save all parameters of deep learning pipelines such as model, optimizer, input datasets, and augmentation parameters and to be able to recreate the same pipeline using that data. Albumentations has built-in functionality to serialize the augmentation parameters and save them. Then you can use those parameters to recreate an augmentation pipeline.

A . save ( transform , '/tmp/transform.json' ) To load a serialized representation from a JSON file, use the load function from Albumentations. loaded_transform = A . load ( '/tmp/transform.json' ) print ( loaded_transform ) Compose([ RandomCrop(always_apply=False, p=1.0, height=768, width=768), OneOf([ RGBShift(always_apply=False, p=0.5, r_shift_limit=(-20, 20), g_shift_limit=(-20, 20), b_shift_limit=(-20, 20)), HueSaturationValue(always_apply=False, p=0.5, hue_shift_limit=(-20, 20), sat_shift_limit=(-30, 30), val_shift_limit=(-20, 20)), ], p=0.5), ], p=1.0, bbox_params=None, keypoint_params=None, additional_targets={}) Next, we will use the same random seed as before and apply the loaded augmentation pipeline to the same image. random . seed ( 42 ) transformed_from_loaded_transform = loaded_transform ( image = image ) visualize ( transformed_from_loaded_transform [ 'image' ]) assert np . array_equal ( transformed [ 'image' ], transformed_from_loaded_transform [ 'image' ]) As you see, it produced the same result. Using YAML insted of JSON \u00b6 You can also use YAML instead of JSON for serializing and deserializing of augmentation pipelines. To do that add the data_format='yaml' argument to the save and load functions. A . save ( transform , '/tmp/transform.yml' , data_format = 'yaml' ) loaded_transform = A . load ( '/tmp/transform.yml' , data_format = 'yaml' ) print ( loaded_transform ) Compose([ RandomCrop(always_apply=False, p=1.0, height=768, width=768), OneOf([ RGBShift(always_apply=False, p=0.5, r_shift_limit=(-20, 20), g_shift_limit=(-20, 20), b_shift_limit=(-20, 20)), HueSaturationValue(always_apply=False, p=0.5, hue_shift_limit=(-20, 20), sat_shift_limit=(-30, 30), val_shift_limit=(-20, 20)), ], p=0.5), ], p=1.0, bbox_params=None, keypoint_params=None, additional_targets={}) Serializing an augmentation pipeline to a Python dictionary \u00b6 If you need more control over a serialized pipeline, e.g., you want to save a serialized version to a database or send it to a server you can use the to_dict and from_dict functions. to_dict returns a Python dictionary that describes a pipeline. The dictionary will contain only primitive data types such as dictionaries, lists, strings, integers, and floats. To construct a pipeline from a dictionary, you need to call from_dict . transform_dict = A . to_dict ( transform ) loaded_transform = A . from_dict ( transform_dict ) print ( loaded_transform ) Compose([ RandomCrop(always_apply=False, p=1.0, height=768, width=768), OneOf([ RGBShift(always_apply=False, p=0.5, r_shift_limit=(-20, 20), g_shift_limit=(-20, 20), b_shift_limit=(-20, 20)), HueSaturationValue(always_apply=False, p=0.5, hue_shift_limit=(-20, 20), sat_shift_limit=(-30, 30), val_shift_limit=(-20, 20)), ], p=0.5), ], p=1.0, bbox_params=None, keypoint_params=None, additional_targets={}) Serializing and deserializing Lambda transforms \u00b6 Lambda transforms use custom transformation functions provided by a user. For those types of transforms, Albumentations saves only the name and the position in the augmentation pipeline. To deserialize an augmentation pipeline with Lambda transforms, you need to manually provide all Lambda transform instances using the lambda_transforms argument. Let's define a function that we will use to transform an image. def hflip_image ( image , ** kwargs ): return cv2 . flip ( image , 1 ) Next, we create a Lambda transform that will apply the hflip_image function to input images. Note that to make the transform serializable, you need to pass the name argument. hflip = A . Lambda ( name = 'hflip_image' , image = hflip_image , p = 0.5 ) transform = A . Compose ([ hflip ]) print ( transform ) Compose([ Lambda(name='hflip_image', image=<function hflip_image at 0x7feae89a77b8>, mask=<function noop at 0x7fead8ad2268>, keypoint=<function noop at 0x7fead8ad2268>, bbox=<function noop at 0x7fead8ad2268>, always_apply=False, p=0.5), ], p=1.0, bbox_params=None, keypoint_params=None, additional_targets={}) To check that transform is working, we will apply to an image. random . seed ( 7 ) transformed = transform ( image = image ) visualize ( transformed [ 'image' ]) To serialize a pipeline with a Lambda transform, use the save function as before. A . save ( transform , '/tmp/lambda_transform.json' ) To deserialize a pipeline that contains Lambda transforms, you need to pass names and instances of all Lambda transforms in a pipeline through the lambda_transforms argument. loaded_transform = A . load ( '/tmp/lambda_transform.json' , lambda_transforms = { 'hflip_image' : hflip }) print ( loaded_transform ) Compose([ Lambda(name='hflip_image', image=<function hflip_image at 0x7feae89a77b8>, mask=<function noop at 0x7fead8ad2268>, keypoint=<function noop at 0x7fead8ad2268>, bbox=<function noop at 0x7fead8ad2268>, always_apply=False, p=0.5), ], p=1.0, bbox_params=None, keypoint_params=None, additional_targets={}) Verify that the deserialized pipeline produces the same output. random . seed ( 7 ) transformed_from_loaded_transform = loaded_transform ( image = image ) assert np . array_equal ( transformed [ 'image' ], transformed_from_loaded_transform [ 'image' ]) To serialize and deserialize Lambda transforms to and from dictionaries use to_dict and from_dict . transform_dict = A . to_dict ( transform ) print ( transform_dict ) {'__version__': '0.4.5', 'transform': {'__class_fullname__': 'albumentations.core.composition.Compose', 'p': 1.0, 'transforms': [{'__type__': 'Lambda', '__name__': 'hflip_image'}], 'bbox_params': None, 'keypoint_params': None, 'additional_targets': {}}} loaded_transform = A . from_dict ( transform_dict , lambda_transforms = { 'hflip_image' : hflip })","title":"How to save and load parameters of an augmentation pipeline"},{"location":"examples/serialization/#how-to-save-and-load-parameters-of-an-augmentation-pipeline","text":"Reproducibility is very important in deep learning.

There are multiple formats of bounding boxes annotations. Each format uses its specific representation of bouning boxes coordinates. Albumentations supports four formats: pascal_voc , albumentations , coco , and yolo . Let's take a look at each of those formats and how they represent coordinates of bounding boxes. As an example, we will use an image from the dataset named Common Objects in Context . It contains one bounding box that marks a cat. The image width is 640 pixels, and its height is 480 pixels. The width of the bounding box is 322 pixels, and its height is 117 pixels. The bounding box has the following (x, y) coordinates of its corners: top-left is (x_min, y_min) or (98px, 345px) , top-right is (x_max, y_min) or (420px, 345px) , bottom-left is (x_min, y_max) or (98px, 462px) , bottom-right is (x_max, y_max) or (420px, 462px) . As you see, coordinates of the bounding box's corners are calculated with respect to the top-left corner of the image which has (x, y) coordinates (0, 0) . An example image with a bounding box from the COCO dataset pascal_voc \u00b6 pascal_voc is a format used by the Pascal VOC dataset . Coordinates of a bounding box are encoded with four values in pixels: [x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max] . x_min and y_min are coordinates of the top-left corner of the bounding box. x_max and y_max are coordinates of bottom-right corner of the bounding box. Coordinates of the example bounding box in this format are [98, 345, 420, 462] . albumentations \u00b6 albumentations is similar to pascal_voc , because it also uses four values [x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max] to represent a bounding box. But unlike pascal_voc , albumentations uses normalized values. To normalize values, we divide coordinates in pixels for the x- and y-axis by the width and the height of the image. Coordinates of the example bounding box in this format are [98 / 640, 345 / 480, 420 / 640, 462 / 480] which are [0.153125, 0.71875, 0.65625, 0.9625] . Albumentations uses this format internally to work with bounding boxes and augment them. coco \u00b6 coco is a format used by the Common Objects in Context COCO COCO dataset. In coco , a bounding box is defined by four values in pixels [x_min, y_min, width, height] . They are coordinates of the top-left corner along with the width and height of the bounding box. Coordinates of the example bounding box in this format are [98, 345, 322, 117] . yolo \u00b6 In yolo , a bounding box is represented by four values [x_center, y_center, width, height] . x_center and y_center are the normalized coordinates of the center of the bounding box. To make coordinates normalized, we take pixel values of x and y, which marks the center of the bounding box on the x- and y-axis. Then we divide the value of x by the width of the image and value of y by the height of the image. width and height represent the width and the height of the bounding box. They are normalized as well. Coordinates of the example bounding box in this format are [((420 + 98) / 2) / 640, ((462 + 365) / 2) / 480, 322 / 640, 117 / 480] which are [0.4046875, 0.8614583, 0.503125, 0.24375] . How different formats represent coordinates of a bounding box Bounding boxes augmentation \u00b6 Just like with images and masks augmentation, the process of augmenting bounding boxes consists of 4 steps. You import the required libraries. You define an augmentation pipeline. You read images and bounding boxes from the disk. You pass an image and bounding boxes to the augmentation pipeline and receive augmented images and boxes. Note Some transforms in Albumentation don't support bounding boxes. If you try to use them you will get an exception. Please refer to this article to check whether a transform can augment bounding boxes. Step 1. Import the required libraries. \u00b6 import albumentations as A import cv2 Step 2. Define an augmentation pipeline. \u00b6 Here an example of a minimal declaration of an augmentation pipeline that works with bounding boxes. transform = A . Compose ([ A . RandomCrop ( width = 450 , height = 450 ), A . HorizontalFlip ( p = 0.5 ), A . RandomBrightnessContrast ( p = 0.2 ), ], bbox_params = A . BboxParams ( format = 'coco' )) Note that unlike image and masks augmentation, Compose now has an additional parameter bbox_params . You need to pass an instance of A.BboxParams to that argument. A.BboxParams specifies settings for working with bounding boxes. format sets the format for bounding boxes coordinates. It can either be pascal_voc , albumentations , coco or yolo . This value is required because Albumentation needs to know the coordinates' source format for bounding boxes to apply augmentations correctly. Besides format , A.BboxParams supports a few more settings. Here is an example of Compose that shows all available settings with A.BboxParams : transform = A . Compose ([ A . RandomCrop ( width = 450 , height = 450 ), A . HorizontalFlip ( p = 0.5 ), A . RandomBrightnessContrast ( p = 0.2 ), ], bbox_params = A . BboxParams ( format = 'coco' , min_area = 1024 , min_visibility = 0.1 , label_fields = [ 'class_labels' ])) min_area and min_visibility \u00b6 min_area and min_visibility parameters control what Albumentations should do to the augmented bounding boxes if their size has changed after augmentation. The size of bounding boxes could change if you apply spatial augmentations, for example, when you crop a part of an image or when you resize an image. min_area is a value in pixels. If the area of a bounding box after augmentation becomes smaller than min_area , Albumentations will drop that box. So the returned list of augmented bounding boxes won't contain that bounding box. min_visibility is a value between 0 and 1. If the ratio of the bounding box area after augmentation to the area of the bounding box before augmentation becomes smaller than min_visibility , Albumentations will drop that box. So if the augmentation process cuts the most of the bounding box, that box won't be present in the returned list of the augmented bounding boxes. Here is an example image that contains two bounding boxes. Bounding boxes coordinates are declared using the coco format. An example image with two bounding boxes First, we apply the CenterCrop augmentation without declaring parameters min_area and min_visiiblity . The augmented image contains two bounding boxes. An example image with two bounding boxes after applying augmentation Next, we apply the same CenterCrop augmentation, but now we also use the min_area parameter. Now, the augmented image contains only one bounding box, because the other bounding box's area after augmentation became smaller than min_area , so Albumentations dropped that bounding box. An example image with one bounding box after applying augmentation with 'min_area' Finally, we apply the CenterCrop augmentation with the min_visibility . After that augmentation, the resulting image doesn't contain any bounding box, because visibility of all bounding boxes after augmentation are below threshold set by min_visibility . An example image with zero bounding boxes after applying augmentation with 'min_visibility' Class labels for bounding boxes \u00b6 Besides coordinates, each bounding box should have an associated class label that tells which object lies inside the bounding box. There are two ways to pass a label for a bounding box. Let's say you have an example image with three objects: dog , cat , and sports ball . Bounding boxes coordinates in the coco format for those objects are [23, 74, 295, 388] , [377, 294, 252, 161] , and [333, 421, 49, 49] . An example image with 3 bounding boxes from the COCO dataset 1. You can pass labels along with bounding boxes coordinates by adding them as additional values to the list of coordinates. \u00b6 For the image above, bounding boxes with class labels will become [23, 74, 295, 388, 'dog'] , [377, 294, 252, 161, 'cat'] , and [333, 421, 49, 49, 'sports ball'] . Class labels could be of any type: integer, string, or any other Python data type. For example, integer values as class labels will look the following: [23, 74, 295, 388, 18] , [377, 294, 252, 161, 17] , and [333, 421, 49, 49, 37]. Also, you can use multiple class values for each bounding box, for example [23, 74, 295, 388, 'dog', 'animal'] , [377, 294, 252, 161, 'cat', 'animal'] , and [333, 421, 49, 49, 'sports ball', 'item'] . 2.You can pass labels for bounding boxes as a separate list (the preferred way). \u00b6 For example, if you have three bounding boxes like [23, 74, 295, 388] , [377, 294, 252, 161] , and [333, 421, 49, 49] you can create a separate list with values like ['cat', 'dog', 'sports ball'] , or [18, 17, 37] that contains class labels for those bounding boxes. Next, you pass that list with class labels as a separate argument to the transform function. Albumentations needs to know the names of all those lists with class labels to join them with augmented bounding boxes correctly. Then, if a bounding box is dropped after augmentation because it is no longer visible, Albumentations will drop the class label for that box as well. Use label_fields parameter to set names for all arguments in transform that will contain label descriptions for bounding boxes (more on that in Step 4). Step 3. Read images and bounding boxes from the disk. \u00b6 Read an image from the disk. image = cv2 . imread ( \"/path/to/image.jpg\" ) image = cv2 . cvtColor ( image , cv2 . COLOR_BGR2RGB ) Bounding boxes can be stored on the disk in different serialization formats: JSON, XML, YAML, CSV, etc. So the code to read bounding boxes depends on the actual format of data on the disk. After you read the data from the disk, you need to prepare bounding boxes for Albumentations. Albumentations expects that bounding boxes will be represented as a list of lists. Each list contains information about a single bounding box. A bounding box definition should have at list four elements that represent the coordinates of that bounding box. The actual meaning of those four values depends on the format of bounding boxes (either pascal_voc , albumentations , coco , or yolo ). Besides four coordinates, each definition of a bounding box may contain one or more extra values. You can use those extra values to store additional information about the bounding box, such as a class label of the object inside the box. During augmentation, Albumentations will not process those extra values. The library will return them as is along with the updated coordinates of the augmented bounding box. Step 4. Pass an image and bounding boxes to the augmentation pipeline and receive augmented images and boxes. \u00b6 As discussed in Step 2, there are two ways of passing class labels along with bounding boxes coordinates: 1. Pass class labels along with coordinates. \u00b6 So, if you have coordinates of three bounding boxes that look like this: bboxes = [ [ 23 , 74 , 295 , 388 ], [ 377 , 294 , 252 , 161 ], [ 333 , 421 , 49 , 49 ], ] you can add a class label for each bounding box as an additional element of the list along with four coordinates. So now a list with bounding boxes and their coordinates will look the following: bboxes = [ [ 23 , 74 , 295 , 388 , 'dog' ], [ 377 , 294 , 252 , 161 , 'cat' ], [ 333 , 421 , 49 , 49 , 'sports ball' ], ] or with multiple labels per each bounding box: bboxes = [ [ 23 , 74 , 295 , 388 , 'dog' , 'animal' ], [ 377 , 294 , 252 , 161 , 'cat' , 'animal' ], [ 333 , 421 , 49 , 49 , 'sports ball' , 'item' ], ] You can use any data type for declaring class labels. It can be string, integer, or any other Python data type. Next, you pass an image and bounding boxes for it to the transform function and receive the augmented image and bounding boxes. transformed = transform ( image = image , bboxes = bboxes ) transformed_image = transformed [ 'image' ] transformed_bboxes = transformed [ 'bboxes' ] Example input and output data for bounding boxes augmentation 2. Pass class labels in a separate argument to transform (the preferred way). \u00b6 Let's say you have coordinates of three bounding boxes bboxes = [ [ 23 , 74 , 295 , 388 ], [ 377 , 294 , 252 , 161 ], [ 333 , 421 , 49 , 49 ], ] You can create a separate list that contains class labels for those bounding boxes: class_labels = [ 'cat' , 'dog' , 'parrot' ] Then you pass both bounding boxes and class labels to transform . Note that to pass class labels, you need to use the name of the argument that you declared in label_fields when creating an instance of Compose in step 2. In our case, we set the name of the argument to class_labels . transformed = transform ( image = image , bboxes = bboxes , class_labels = class_labels ) transformed_image = transformed [ 'image' ] transformed_bboxes = transformed [ 'bboxes' ] transformed_class_labels = transformed [ 'class_labels' ] Example input and output data for bounding boxes augmentation with a separate argument for class labels Note that label_fields expects a list, so you can set multiple fields that contain labels for your bounding boxes. So if you declare Compose like transform = A . Compose ([ A . RandomCrop ( width = 450 , height = 450 ), A . HorizontalFlip ( p = 0.5 ), A . RandomBrightnessContrast ( p = 0.2 ), ], bbox_params = A . BboxParams ( format = 'coco' , label_fields = [ 'class_labels' , 'class_categories' ]))) you can use those multiple arguments to pass info about class labels, like class_labels = [ 'cat' , 'dog' , 'parrot' ] class_categories = [ 'animal' , 'animal' , 'item' ] transformed = transform ( image = image , bboxes = bboxes , class_labels = class_labels , class_categories = class_categories ) transformed_image = transformed [ 'image' ] transformed_bboxes = transformed [ 'bboxes' ] transformed_class_labels = transformed [ 'class_labels' ] transformed_class_categories = transformed [ 'class_categories' ] Examples \u00b6 Using Albumentations to augment bounding boxes for object detection tasks How to use Albumentations for detection tasks if you need to keep all bounding boxes Showcase.

As an argument to the Compose class, you need to pass a list of augmentations you want to apply. A call to Compose will return a transform function that will perform image augmentation. Let's look at an example: transform = A . Compose ([ A . RandomCrop ( width = 256 , height = 256 ), A . HorizontalFlip ( p = 0.5 ), A . RandomBrightnessContrast ( p = 0.2 ), ]) In the example, Compose receives a list with three augmentations: A.RandomCrop , A.HorizontalFlip , and A.RandomBrighntessContrast . You can find the full list of all available augmentations in the GitHub repository and in the API Docs . A demo playground that demonstrates how augmentations will transform the input image is available at https://albumentations-demo.herokuapp.com . To create an augmentation, you create an instance of the required augmentation class and pass augmentation parameters to it. A.RandomCrop receives two parameters, height and width . A.RandomCrop(width=256, height=256) means that A.RandomCrop will take an input image, extract a random patch with size 256 by 256 pixels from it and then pass the result to the next augmentation in the pipeline (in this case to A.HorizontalFlip ). A.HorizontalFlip in this example has one parameter named p . p is a special parameter that is supported by almost all augmentations. It controls the probability of applying the augmentation. p=0.5 means that with a probability of 50%, the transform will flip the image horizontally, and with a probability of 50%, the transform won't modify the input image. A.RandomBrighntessContrast in the example also has one parameter, p . With a probability of 20%, this augmentation will change the brightness and contrast of the image received from A.HorizontalFlip . And with a probability of 80%, it will keep the received image unchanged. A visualized version of the augmentation pipeline. You pass an image to it, the image goes through all transformations, and then you receive an augmented image from the pipeline. Step 3. Read images from the disk. \u00b6 To pass an image to the augmentation pipeline, you need to read it from the disk. The pipeline expects to receive an image in the form of a NumPy array. If it is a color image, it should have three channels in the following order: Red, Green, Blue (so a regular RGB image). To read images from the disk, you can use OpenCV - a popular library for image processing. It supports a lot of input formats and is installed along with Albumentations since Albumentations utilizes that library under the hood for a lot of augmentations. To import OpenCV import cv2 To read an image with OpenCV image = cv2 . imread ( \"/path/to/image.jpg\" ) image = cv2 . cvtColor ( image , cv2 . COLOR_BGR2RGB ) Note the usage of cv2.cvtColor . For historical reasons , OpenCV reads an image in BGR format (so color channels of the image have the following order: Blue, Green, Red). Albumentations uses the most common and popular RGB image format. So when using OpenCV, we need to convert the image format to RGB explicitly. Besides OpenCV, you can use other image processing libraries. Pillow \u00b6 Pillow is a popular Python image processing library. Install Pillow pip install pillow Import Pillow and NumPy (we need NumPy to convert a Pillow image to a NumPy array. NumPy is already installed along with Albumentations). from PIL import Image import numpy as np Read an image with Pillow and convert it to a NumPy array. pillow_image = Image . open ( \"image.jpg\" ) image = np . array ( pillow_image ) Step 4. Pass images to the augmentation pipeline and receive augmented images. \u00b6 To pass an image to the augmentation pipeline you need to call the transform function created by a call to A.Compose at Step 2. In the image argument to that function, you need to pass an image that you want to augment. transformed = transform ( image = image ) transform will return a dictionary with a single key image . Value at that key will contain an augmented image. transformed_image = transformed [ \"image\" ] To augment the next image, you need to call transform again and pass a new image as the image argument: another_transformed_image = transform ( image = another_image )[ \"image\" ] Each augmentation will change the input image with the probability set by the parameter p . Also, many augmentations have parameters that control the magnitude of changes that will be applied to an image. For example, A.RandomBrightnessContrast has two parameters: brightness_limit that controls the magnitude of adjusting brightness and contrast_limit that controls the magnitude of adjusting contrast. The bigger the value, the more the augmentation will change an image. During augmentation, a magnitude of the transformation is sampled from a uniform distribution limited by brightness_limit and contrast_limit . That means that if you make multiple calls to transform with the same input image, you will get a different output image each time. transform = A . Compose ([ A . RandomBrightnessContrast ( brightness_limit = 1 , contrast_limit = 1 , p = 1.0 ), ]) transformed_image_1 = transform ( image = image )[ 'image' ] transformed_image_2 = transform ( image = image )[ 'image' ] transformed_image_3 = transform ( image = image )[ 'image' ] Examples \u00b6 Defining a simple augmentation pipeline for image augmentation Working with non-8-bit images Weather augmentations in Albumentations Showcase.

To create an augmentation, you create an instance of the required augmentation class and pass augmentation parameters to it. A.RandomCrop receives two parameters, height and width . A.RandomCrop(width=256, height=256) means that A.RandomCrop will take an input image, extract a random patch with size 256 by 256 pixels from it and then pass the result to the next augmentation in the pipeline (in this case to A.HorizontalFlip ). A.HorizontalFlip in this example has one parameter named p . p is a special parameter that is supported by almost all augmentations. It controls the probability of applying the augmentation. p=0.5 means that with a probability of 50%, the transform will flip the image horizontally, and with a probability of 50%, the transform won't modify the input image. A.RandomBrighntessContrast in the example also has one parameter, p . With a probability of 20%, this augmentation will change the brightness and contrast of the image received from A.HorizontalFlip . And with a probability of 80%, it will keep the received image unchanged. A visualized version of the augmentation pipeline. You pass an image to it, the image goes through all transformations, and then you receive an augmented image from the pipeline.","title":"Step 2. Define an augmentation pipeline."},{"location":"getting_started/image_augmentation/#step-3-read-images-from-the-disk","text":"To pass an image to the augmentation pipeline, you need to read it from the disk. The pipeline expects to receive an image in the form of a NumPy array. If it is a color image, it should have three channels in the following order: Red, Green, Blue (so a regular RGB image). To read images from the disk, you can use OpenCV - a popular library for image processing. It supports a lot of input formats and is installed along with Albumentations since Albumentations utilizes that library under the hood for a lot of augmentations. To import OpenCV import cv2 To read an image with OpenCV image = cv2 . imread ( \"/path/to/image.jpg\" ) image = cv2 . cvtColor ( image , cv2 . COLOR_BGR2RGB ) Note the usage of cv2.cvtColor . For historical reasons , OpenCV reads an image in BGR format (so color channels of the image have the following order: Blue, Green, Red). Albumentations uses the most common and popular RGB image format. So when using OpenCV, we need to convert the image format to RGB explicitly.

Also, many augmentations have parameters that control the magnitude of changes that will be applied to an image. For example, A.RandomBrightnessContrast has two parameters: brightness_limit that controls the magnitude of adjusting brightness and contrast_limit that controls the magnitude of adjusting contrast. The bigger the value, the more the augmentation will change an image. During augmentation, a magnitude of the transformation is sampled from a uniform distribution limited by brightness_limit and contrast_limit .

In the case of pose estimation, keypoints mark human joints such as shoulder, elbow, wrist, knee, etc. Keypoints annotations along with visualized edges between keypoints. Images are from the COCO dataset . In the case of face detection, keypoints mark important areas of the face such as eyes, nose, corners of the mouth, etc. Facial keypoints. Source: the \"Facial Keypoints Detection\" competition on Kaggle . To define a keypoint, you usually need two values, x and y coordinates of the keypoint. Coordinates of the keypoint are calculated with respect to the top-left corner of the image which has (x, y) coordinates (0, 0) . Often keypoints have associated labels such as right_elbow , left_wrist , etc. An example image with five keypoints from the COCO dataset Some classical computer vision algorithms, such as SIFT, may use four values to describe a keypoint. In addition to the x and y coordinates, there are keypoint scale and keypoint angle. Albumentations support those values as well.

A keypoint is defined by x and y coordinates in pixels, the scale, and the angle. Augmenting keypoints \u00b6 The process of augmenting keypoints looks very similar to the bounding boxes augmentation. It consists of 4 steps. You import the required libraries. You define an augmentation pipeline. You read images and keypoints from the disk. You pass an image and keypoints to the augmentation pipeline and receive augmented images and keypoints. Note Some transforms in Albumentation don't support keypoints. If you try to use them you will get an exception. Please refer to this article to check whether a transform can augment keypoints. Step 1. Import the required libraries. \u00b6 import albumentations as A import cv2 Step 2. Define an augmentation pipeline. \u00b6 Here an example of a minimal declaration of an augmentation pipeline that works with keypoints. transform = A . Compose ([ A . RandomCrop ( width = 330 , height = 330 ), A . RandomBrightnessContrast ( p = 0.2 ), ], keypoint_params = A . KeypointParams ( format = 'xy' )) Note that just like with bounding boxes, Compose has an additional parameter that defines the format for keypoints' coordinates. In the case of keypoints, it is called keypoint_params . Here we pass an instance of A.KeypointParams that says that xy coordinates format should be used. Besides format , A.KeypointParams supports a few more settings. Here is an example of Compose that shows all available settings with A.KeypointParams transform = A . Compose ([ A . RandomCrop ( width = 330 , height = 330 ), A . RandomBrightnessContrast ( p = 0.2 ), ], keypoint_params = A . KeypointParams ( format = 'xy' , label_fields = [ 'class_labels' ], remove_invisible = True , angle_in_degrees = True )) label_fields \u00b6 In some computer vision tasks, keypoints have not only coordinates but associated labels as well. For example, in pose estimation, each keypoint has a label such as elbow , knee or wrist . You need to pass those labels in a separate argument (or arguments, because you can use multiple fields) to the transform function that will augment keypoints. label_fields defines names of those fields. Step 4 describes how you need to use the transform function. remove_invisible \u00b6 After the augmentation, some keypoints may become invisible because they will be located outside of the augmented image's visible area. For example, if you crop a part of the image, all the keypoints outside of the cropped area will become invisible. If remove_invisible is set to True , Albumentations won't return invisible keypoints. remove_invisible is set to True by default, so if you don't pass that argument, Albumentations won't return invisible keypoints. angle_in_degrees \u00b6 If angle_in_degrees is set to True (this is the default value), then Albumentations expects that the angle value in formats xya , xyas , and xysa is defined in angles. If angle_in_degrees is set to False , Albumentations expects that the angle value is specified in radians. This setting doesn't affect xy and yx formats, because those formats don't use angles. 3. Read images and keypoints from the disk. \u00b6 Read an image from the disk. image = cv2 . imread ( \"/path/to/image.jpg\" ) image = cv2 . cvtColor ( image , cv2 . COLOR_BGR2RGB ) Keypoints can be stored on the disk in different serialization formats: JSON, XML, YAML, CSV, etc. So the code to read keypoints depends on the actual format of data on the disk. After you read the data from the disk, you need to prepare keypoints for Albumentations. Albumentations expects that keypoint will be represented as a list of lists. Each list contains information about a single keypoint. A definition of keypoint should have two to four elements depending on the selected format of keypoints. The first two elements are x and y coordinates of a keypoint in pixels (or y and x coordinates in the yx format). The third and fourth elements may be the angle and the scale of keypoint if you select a format that uses those values. Step 4. Pass an image and keypoints to the augmentation pipeline and receive augmented images and boxes. \u00b6 Let's say you have an example image with five keypoints. A list with those five keypoints' coordinates in the xy format will look the following: keypoints = [ ( 264 , 203 ), ( 86 , 88 ), ( 254 , 160 ), ( 193 , 103 ), ] Then you pass those keypoints to the transform function along with the image and receive the augmented versions of image and keypoints. transformed = transform ( image = image , keypoints = keypoints ) transformed_image = transformed [ 'image' ] transformed_keypoints = transformed [ 'keypoints' ] The augmented image with augmented keypoints If you set remove_invisible to False in keypoint_params , then Albumentations will return all keypoints, even if they lie outside the visible area. In the example image below, you can see that the keypoint for the right elbow is located outside the image, but Albumentations still retuned it. The area outside the image is highlighted in yellow. When remove_invisible is set to False Albumentations will return all keypoints, even those located outside the image If keypoints have associated class labels, you need to create a list that contains those labels: class_labels = [ 'left_elbow' , 'right_elbow' , 'left_wrist' , 'right_wrist' , 'right_hip' , ] Also, you need to declare the name of the argument to transform that will contain those labels. For declaration, you need to use the label_fields parameters of A.KeypointParams . For example, we could use the class_labels name for the argument with labels. transform = A . Compose ([ A . RandomCrop ( width = 330 , height = 330 ), A . RandomBrightnessContrast ( p = 0.2 ), ], keypoint_params = A . KeypointParams ( format = 'xy' , label_fields = [ 'class_labels' ])) Next, you pass both keypoints' coordinates and class labels to transform . transformed = transform ( image = image , keypoints = keypoints , class_labels = class_labels ) transformed_image = transformed [ 'image' ] transformed_keypoints = transformed [ 'keypoints' ] transformed_class_labels = transformed [ 'class_labels' ] Note that label_fields expects a list, so you can set multiple fields that contain labels for your keypoints. So if you declare Compose like transform = A . Compose ([ A . RandomCrop ( width = 330 , height = 330 ), A . RandomBrightnessContrast ( p = 0.2 ), ], keypoint_params = A . KeypointParams ( format = 'xy' , label_fields = [ 'class_labels' , 'class_sides' ])) you can use those multiple arguments to pass info about class labels, like class_labels = [ 'left_elbow' , 'right_elbow' , 'left_wrist' , 'right_wrist' , 'right_hip' , ] class_sides = [ 'left' , 'right' , 'left' , 'right' , 'right' ] transformed = transform ( image = image , keypoints = keypoints , class_labels = class_labels , class_sides = class_sides ) transformed_class_sides = transformed [ 'class_sides' ] transformed_class_labels = transformed [ 'class_labels' ] transformed_keypoints = transformed [ 'keypoints' ] transformed_image = transformed [ 'image' ] Example input and output data for keypoints augmentation with two separate arguments for class labels Note Some augmentations may affect class labels and make them incorrect. For example, the HorizontalFlip augmentation mirrors the input image. When you apply that augmentation to keypoints that mark the side of body parts (left or right), those keypoints will point to the wrong side (since left on the mirrored image becomes right ). So when you are creating an augmentation pipeline look carefully which augmentations. could be applied to the input data.

All other augmentations have the default value of p set 0.5, which means that by default, they will be applied to 50% of instances of input data.

In this pipeline, we use three placeholder values to set probabilities: p1 , p2 , and p3 . Let's take a closer look at them. p1 \u00b6 p1 sets the probability that the augmentation pipeline will apply augmentations at all. If p1 is set to 0, then augmentations inside Compose will never be applied to the input image, so the augmentation pipeline will always return the input image unchanged. If p1 is set to 1, then all augmentations inside Compose will have a chance to be applied. The example above contains two augmentations inside Compose : RandomRotate90 and the OneOf block with two child augmentations (more on their probabilities later). Any value of p1 between 0 and 1 means that augmentations inside Compose could be applied with the probability between 0 and 100%. If p1 equals to 1 or p1 is less than 1, but the random generator decides to apply augmentations inside Compose probabilities p2 and p3 come into play. p2 \u00b6 Each augmentation inside Compose has a probability of being applied. p2 sets the probability of applying RandomRotate90 . In the example above, p2 equals 0.85, so RandomRotate90 has an 85% chance to be applied to the input image. p3 \u00b6 p3 sets the probability of applying the OneOf block.

The OneOf block applies one of the augmentations inside it. That means that if the random generator chooses to apply OneOf then one child augmentation from it will be applied to the input data. To decide which augmentation within the OneOf block is used, Albumentations uses the following rule: The OneOf block normalizes the probabilities of all augmentations inside it, so their probabilities sum up to 1.

However, it often very difficult to get enough training samples. Multiple reasons could make it very hard or even impossible to gather enough data: To make a training dataset, you need to obtain images and then label them. For example, you need to assign correct class labels if you have an image classification task. For an object detection task, you need to draw bounding boxes around objects. For a semantic segmentation task, you need to assign a correct class to each input image pixel. This process requires manual labor, and sometimes it could be very costly to label the training data. For example, to correctly label medical images, you need expensive domain experts. Sometimes even collecting training images could be hard. There are many legal restrictions for working with healthcare data, and obtaining it requires a lot of effort. Sometimes getting the training images is more feasible, but it will cost a lot of money. For example, to get satellite images, you need to pay a satellite operator to take those photos. To get images for road scene recognition, you need an operator that will drive a car and collect the required data. Image augmentation to the rescue \u00b6 Image augmentation is a process of creating new training examples from the existing ones. To make a new sample, you slightly change the original image. For instance, you could make a new image a little brighter; you could cut a piece from the original image; you could make a new image by mirroring the original one, etc. Here are some examples of transformations of the original image that will create a new training sample. By applying those transformations to the original training dataset, you could create an almost infinite amount of new training samples. How much does image augmentation improves the quality and performance of deep neural networks \u00b6 Basic augmentations techniques were used almost in all papers that describe the state-of-the-art models for image recognition. AlexNet was the first model that demonstrated exceptional capabilities of using deep neural networks for image recognition. For training, the authors used a set of basic image augmentation techniques. They resized original images to the fixed size of 256 by 256 pixels, and then they cropped patches of size 224 by 224 pixels as well as their horizontal reflections from those resized images. Also, they altered the intensities of the RGB channels in images. Successive state-of-the-art models such as Inception , ResNet , and EfficientNet also used image augmentation techniques for training. In 2018 Google published a paper about AutoAugment - an algorithm that automatically discovers the best set of augmentations for the dataset. They showed that a custom set of augmentations improves the performance of the model. Here is a comparison between a model that used only the base set of augmentations and a model that used a specific set of augmentations discovered by AutoAugment. The table shows Top-1 accuracy (%) on the ImageNet validation set; higher is better.

Here is an example of how you could use Pillow , a popular image processing library for Python, to make simple augmentations. from PIL import Image , ImageEnhance image = Image . open ( \"parrot.jpg\" ) mirrored_image = image . transpose ( Image . FLIP_LEFT_RIGHT ) rotated_image = image . rotate ( 45 ) brightness_enhancer = ImageEnhance . Brightness ( image ) brighter_image = brightness_enhancer . enhance ( factor = 1.5 ) However, this approach has many limitations, and it doesn't handle all cases with image augmentation. An image augmentation library such as Albumentations gives you a lot of advantages. Here is a list of few pitfalls that augmentation libraries can handle very well. The need to apply the same transform to an image and for labels for segmentation, object detection, and keypoint detection tasks. \u00b6 For image classification, you need to modify only an input image and keep output labels intact because output labels are invariant to image modifications. Note There are some exceptions to this rule. For example, an image could contain a cat and have an assigned label cat . During image augmentation, if you crop a part of an image that doesn't have a cat on it, then the output label cat becomes wrong and misleading. Usually, you deal with those situations by deciding which augmentations you could apply to a dataset without risking to have problems with incorrect labels. For segmentation, you need to apply some transformations both to an input image and an output mask. You also have to use the same parameters both for the image transformation and the mask transformation. Let's look at an example of a semantic segmentation task from Inria Aerial Image Labeling Dataset. The dataset contains aerial photos as well as masks for those photos. Each pixel of the mask is marked either as 1 if the pixel belongs to the class building and 0 otherwise. There are two types of image augmentations: pixel-level augmentations and spatial-level augmentations. Pixel-level augmentations change the values of pixels of the original image, but they don't change the output mask. Image transformations such as changing brightness or contrast of adjusting values of the RGB-palette of the image are pixel-level augmentations. We modify the input image by adjusting its brightness, but we keep the output mask intact. On the contrary, spatial-level augmentations change both the image and the mask. When you apply image transformations such as mirroring or rotation or cropping a part of the input image, you also need to apply the same transformation to the output label to preserve its correctness. We rotate both the input image and the output mask. We use the same set of transformations with the same parameters, both for the image and the mask. The same is true for object detection tasks. For pixel-level augmentations, you only need to change the input image. With spatial-level augmentations, you need to apply the same transformation not only to the image but for bounding boxes coordinates as well. After applying spatial-level augmentations, you need to update coordinates of bounding boxes to represent the correct locations of objects on the augmented image. Pixel-level augmentations such as brightness adjustment change only the input image but not the coordinates of bounding boxes. Spatial-level augmentations such as mirroring and cropping a part of the image change both the input image and the bounding boxes' coordinates. Albumentations knows how to correctly apply transformation both to the input data as well as the output labels. Working with probabilities \u00b6 During training, you usually want to apply augmentations with a probability of less than 100% since you also need to have the original images in your training pipeline. Also, it is beneficial to be able to control the magnitude of image augmentation, how much does the augmentation change the original image. If the original dataset is large, you could apply only the basic augmentations with probability around 10-30% and with a small magnitude of changes. If the dataset is small, you need to act more aggressively with augmentations to prevent overfitting of neural networks, so you usually need to increase the probability of applying each augmentation to 40-50% and increase the magnitude of changes the augmentation makes to the image. Image augmentation libraries allow you to set the required probabilities and the magnitude of values for each transformation. Declarative definition of the augmentation pipeline and unified interface \u00b6 Usually, you want to apply not a single augmentation, but a set of augmentations with specific parameters such as probability and magnitude of changes. Augmentation libraries allow you to declare such a pipeline in a single place and then use it for image transformation through a unified interface. Some libraries can store and load transformation parameters to formats such as JSON, YAML, etc. Here is an example definition of an augmentation pipeline. This pipeline will first crop a random 512px x 512px part of the input image. Then with probability 30%, it will randomly change brightness and contrast of that crop. Finally, with probability 30%, it will horizontally flip the resulting image. import albumentations as A transform = A . Compose ([ A . RandomCrop ( 512 , 512 ), A . RandomBrightnessContrast ( p = 0.3 ), A . HorizontalFlip ( p = 0.5 ), ]) Rigorous testing \u00b6 A bug in the augmentation pipeline could easily go unnoticed. A buggy pipeline could silently corrupt input data. There won't be any exceptions and code failures, but the performance of trained neural networks will degrade because they received a garbage input during training. Augmentation libraries usually have large test suites that capture regressions during development. Also large user base helps to find unnoticed bugs and report them to developers.","title":"Why you need a dedicated library for image augmentation"},{"location":"introduction/why_you_need_a_dedicated_library_for_image_augmentation/#why-you-need-a-dedicated-library-for-image-augmentation","text":"At first glance, image augmentations look very simple; you apply basic transformations to an image: mirroring, cropping, changing brightness and contrast, etc. There are a lot of libraries that could do such image transformations.
