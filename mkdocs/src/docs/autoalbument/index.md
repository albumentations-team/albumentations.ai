# AutoAlbument Overview

AutoAlbument is an AutoML tool that learns image augmentation policies from data using the [Faster AutoAugment algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.06987). It relieves the user from manually selecting augmentations and tuning their parameters. AutoAlbument provides a complete ready-to-use configuration for an augmentation pipeline.

AutoAlbument supports image classification and semantic segmentation tasks.

The library requires Python 3.6 or higher. For installation instructions, please refer to [Installation](installation.md).
